## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
A. python is used in many applications like web devlopment , software development ,data science ,and it has wide range of libraries to extend its uses .
Python is called as high level language because it takes inputs in  user understandable language and converted into machine language .

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
A. In python , we no need to give type casting and memory management is automatic.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
A. pros:
		1.Easy to learn and uderstand 
		2. flexible and extensible
		3. portability 
		4. Large community
  cons:
		1.more runtime
		2.memory consumption is high 
		3.security

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
A.		1. Artificical intelligence and machine Learning 
		2. Desktop GUI
		3.Data analytics and data visualization 
		4.Web development
		5.Game development
		6.Mobile app development
		7.Embedded systems

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
A. variables are the identity of memory locations ,and we declare some value to variable to store .
   we declare it by naming the variable and assigning the value to it according to datatype .


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
A. we can take user input by using the input() function.
	ex: xyz = input()


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
A. The default datatype is string . 

Q8. What is type casting?
A. Type casting means declaring the datatype while assigning value to variable .

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
A. yes, by using list comprehension and split function.

Q10. What are keywords?
A. keywords are the words which are reserved and they are not used as variable names .

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
A. No, because keyword has its own functionality.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
A. indentaion is space given at beginning of newline of code. It relates the block of code .

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
A.  By using print() function 

Q14. What are operators in Python?
A.  operators are symbols used to process some variables and values.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
A. / is used to divide and  get float output . // (floor division) is used for dividing the number to get  int type output

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
A. print("iNeuron"*3)
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
A.		num = int(input("Enter value"))
		if num%2 == 0:
			print(num ,"the value is even")
		else :
			print(num ,"the value is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
A. it is true or false statements

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0
output: 1

0 and 0
output:0

True and False and True
output:False

1 or 0 or 0
output:1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
A.Those are statements used to guide the program to execute based on decision .


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
A. use of if:
		Used when we have only one condition to check 
 use of elif:
		used when we have two conditions to check 
 use of else:
		used to execute some code after the above conditions are not satisfied.


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
A.
age = int(input("Enter the age of person"))
if age >=18: print("I can vote")
else :print("I can't vote")	

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
A. 
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum_of_nums= 0
for i in numbers:
	sum_of_nums+=i
print(sum_of_nums)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output

num1 = int(input("Enter num1 value"))
num2 = int(input("Enter num2 value"))
num3= int(input("Enter num3 value"))
print(max(num1,num2,num3)).



Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```


A.
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
num = []
for i in numbers:
    if i >150 :
        continue
    if i>500 :
        break
    if i%5 == 0 and i < 500:
        num.append(i)
print(num)
